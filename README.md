# Web Scraper

Welcome to the Web Scraper! This Python project provides a simple web scraper using BeautifulSoup and requests. The script allows you to fetch the HTML content of a webpage and perform basic web scraping to extract information.

## How to Use

1. Modify the `target_url` variable in the script with the URL of the webpage you want to scrape.
2. Run the script (`web_scraper.py`).
3. The script will display the scraped information based on your specified logic.

## Features

### Functions

#### `get_webpage(url)`

- Gets the HTML content of a webpage.
- Uses the `requests` library to make a GET request.

#### `scrape_webpage(html_content)`

- Scrapes information from the HTML content of a webpage.
- Uses `BeautifulSoup` to parse HTML and extract information.

## Example Usage

```python
# Example usage
target_url = 'https://example-news-website.com'
webpage_html = get_webpage(target_url)

if webpage_html:
    scraped_data = scrape_webpage(webpage_html)
    if scraped_data:
        print("Scraped Data:")
        for index, data_point in enumerate(scraped_data, start=1):
            print(f"{index}. {data_point}")
    else:
        print("No data scraped.")
```

## Running the Scraper

1. Install required libraries: `pip install requests beautifulsoup4`.
2. Run the script: `python web_scraper.py`.

## Customization

- Modify the `target_url` and scraping logic in the `scrape_webpage` function based on your specific requirements.
- Handle errors and edge cases as needed.
